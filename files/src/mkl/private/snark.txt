You may be consistent or inconsistent, but you should
not switch all the time between the two.



Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high
And told yourself were true
Lost and changing as the days come down to you
Down to you
Constant stranger
You're a kind person
You're a cold person too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

                        J. Mitchell, 1974



   Is mathematical analysis...only a vain play of the mind?
It can give to the physicist only a convenient language; is this
not a mediocre service, which, strictly speaking, could be
done without; and even is it not to be feared that this artificial
language may be a veil interposed between reality and the eye
of the physicist?  Far from it; without this language most
of the intimate analogies of things would have remained
forever unknown to us; and we should forever have been
ignorant of the internal harmony of the world, which is...
the only true objective reality.
				    Henry Poincare'




Time spent wasted is not wasted time.

TERMINAL PREPPIE
(Biafra/Dead Kennedys)

I go to college 
That makes me so cool
I live in a dorm 
And show off by the pool
 
I join the right clubs 
Just to build an impression
I block out thinking
It won't get me ahead

My ambition in life
Is to look good on paper
All I want is a slot
In some big corporation

John Belushi's my hero
I lampoon and I ape him
My news of the world
Comes from Sports Illustrated
 
I'm proud of my trophies
Like my empty beer cans
Stacked in rows up the wall 
To impress all my friends

No, I'm not here to learn
I just want to get drunk
And major in business
And be taught how to fuck

Win! Win!
I always play to win
Wanna fit in like a cog
In the faceless machine

I'm a terminal terminal terminal preppie
terminal terminal terminal preppie
terminal terminal terminal terminal
terminal terminal terminal terminal

I want a wife with tits
Who just smiles all the time
In my centerfold world
Filled with Springsteen and wine

Some day I'll have power
Some day I'll have boats
A tract in some suburb
With Thanksgivings to host

I'm a terminal terminal terminal preppie
terminal terminal terminal preppie
terminal terminal terminal preppie





Take a little dope and walk out in the air.
The stars are all connected to the brain.
By myself a car, I feel power has I climb--now I'm really in control.
Find myself a woman, lay down on the ground--her pleasure comes 
    falling down like rain.
It all looks fine to the naked eye.
But it don't happen that way at all...

When I was one and twenty		When I was one and twenty
  I heard a wise man say,		  I heard say again,
"Give crowns and pounds and guineas	"The heart out of the bosom
  But not your heart away;		  Was never given in vain;
Give pearls away and rubies		'Tis paid with sighs a-plenty
  But keep your fancy free."		  And sold for endless rue."
But I was one and twenty,		And I am two and twenty,
  No use to talk to me.			  And oh, 'tis true, 'tis true.
							A. E. Housman

That's it.  That's all there is.           (Don't Panic)


No one likes us
I don't know why
We may not be perfect
but heaven knows we try
but all around 
even our old friends put us down
let's drop the big one and see what happens

We give them money, but are they grateful
no, they're spiteful, and they're hateful
they don't respect us, so lets suprize them
We'll drop the big one and pulverize them.

Asia's crowded
Europe's too old
Africa's far too hot
and Canada's too cold
South America stole our name
let's drop the big one
They'll be no one left to blame us

We'll save Australia
don't want to hurt no kangeroos
We'll build an amusement park there
they got surfing too

Boom goes London
Boom Paris
more room for you and more room for me
In every city, the whole world round
we'll just be another american town

Oh, how peaceful it will be
We'll set everybody free
you'll wear a japanese kimono babe
be italian shoes for me
they all hate us anyhow
so let's drop the big one now
let's drop the big one now
