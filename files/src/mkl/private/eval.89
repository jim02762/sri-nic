                     For the period:  Oct 88 to Oct 89

Name            LOTTOR, Mark K.    
Title           Assistant Manager, NIC Computer Facility
Organization    Network Information Systems Center (685)

[The following provides the framework for evaluating individual
performance and organization contribution.]


				SECTION I

o  ACTIVITIES, (PROFESSIONAL, PROMOTION, CLIENT, PROJECTS,
   INSTITUTE-RELATED, ETC.):  Briefly described major efforts to which
   you contributed during the review period; summarize your contributions.

Wrote a Unix based tape backup and user archiving system to
support the growing number of NISC Unix users.

Wrote spooler software to enable remoting printing from the 2065 to
printers on the Unix systems.

Wrote RFC 1078, A TCP Port Service Multiplexor, and implemented it
for Tops-20 and Unix systems.

Merged Tops-20 version 7.0 with our monitor and brought up
the latest software release.

Did routine systems programming maintenance of the DEC-2065
including emergency bug fixes and efficiency improvements to
system and user software.  

Continued maintenance, installation and expansion of NISC local area
networking facilities.

Worked with Fred Ostapik, Sun Microsystems, and BBN to resolve
problems and make operational two data gathering machines on
direct MILNET connections for the NAURS project.

Helped with technical specifications for proposals including the
Secure NIC, Security Coordination Center, and Internet NIC.

Wrote a proposal to DCA to replace the 2065's IMP connections with a
gateway in order to transition to new hardware for the NIC project.

Regulary attended Internet Engineering Task Force meetings and gave
presentations on domain name systems statistics I collect.

Answered many technical questions for NISC staff and oustide
callers in all areas of networking.

Received a Recognition Award for helping restore the system
to operational status after a disk crash on a holiday.

Worked out initial connection problems with BARRNET to get SRI connected.

Installed software and database to participate in NYSERNET
White Pages Pilot Project.


				SECTION II


o  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES ACHIEVEMENT: How well did you meet each
   objective in your performance plan?  If there were shortfalls, how would
   you avoid them in the future?  Include progress in meeting own
   professional development plan.

I attended a Unix systems programming seminar about a year ago that
gave me the knowledge I needed to work on bigger Unix projects.
I've worked on some major Unix/C software since then and now feel
pretty confortable programming in that environment.  This will be
important when we transition from a Tops-20 to a Unix system for
our major work.


				SECTION III


o  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: What are your strengths and areas which
   can be improved?  Where will you concentrate your efforts?  In what
   areas and how do you need development assistance?

As Assistant Manager I need to learn more about SRI and government
financing and project administration issues.

I'll continue to work with Vivian as Assistant Manager of the computer
facility, helping with specification, selection and acquistion of new
hardware and software, working with vendors to maintain facilities
and order new products, and helping with technical aspects of other
projects.

I have continued interest in networking protocols concentrating
on new applications and uses for computer networking.
