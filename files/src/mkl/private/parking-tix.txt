Re:  Parking citation #8895020 2     dated 11/11/88 

To whom it may concern:

I have gone thru the trial by written declaration (VC 40902a) procedure
to try to be found not guilty of my parking violation which is
referenced above.  I received a letter last week informing me that I
was found guilty of the violation.  I had already posted the $12 bail.

I am not satisfied with the decision of the court, and I now request
a trail date with the officer present as per VC 40902d.
