Name            LOTTOR, Mark K.	                 For the period   1988
Title           Assistant Manager, NIC Computer Facility
Organization    Network Information Systems Center

[The following provides the framework for evaluating individual
performance and organizational contribution.]


				SECTION I


o  ACTIVITIES, (PROFESSIONAL, PROMOTION, CLIENT, PROJECTS,
   INSTITUTE-RELATED, ETC.):  Briefly described major efforts
   to which you contributed during the review period;  summarize
   your contributions.


Worked with Fred and Vivian to come up with the specifications for
the NAURS RFP.  Helped evalutate and select a winner from the proposals.

Designed, installed, and did initial setup of the NIC/NAURS local area
networks, file servers and workstations, including hardware and
software selection and configuration.

Regularly attended Internet Engineering Task Force meetings and
partially lead the Domain Naming Working Group.

Answered many technical questions for NIC staff and oustide
callers, and gave presentations to reference staff on domain
naming and network protocol issues.

Completed conversion of all NIC software to use the domain system.

Updated and maintained systems software on the DEC-20.  This included
making many programs more reliable and efficient, such as the mailers
and dumper; adding software to support the new ethernet interface;
updating software to support Sun workstations; and fixing many bugs
in the networking code that used to crash the system.


				SECTION II

o  PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES ACHIEVEMENT:  How well did you meet
   each objective in your performance plan.  If there were 
   shortfalls, how would you avoid them in the future?  Include
   progress in meeting own professional development plan.


I extended the areas in which I work to include more than just
programming.  This year I became involved in RFP writing and
evaluation, more internal reference staff helping, facilities
planning, hardware and software selection, and interfacing with
vendors to get problems fixed and equipment ordered.

I've learned a lot more of Unix in the last year, but there
is still much more to learn.


				SECTION III


o  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  What are your strengths and areas
   which can be improved?  Where will you concentrate your efforts?
   In what areas and how do you need development assistance?

I need to have a better understanding of the internal and system
interface facilities of Unix, and I'll be attending a course in a few
months that should help me in that area.

I'll be concentrating more time this year to learning more of Unix,
especially in the systems programming area.

I'll continue to work with Vivian as Assistant Manager of the computer
facility, helping with specification, selection and acquistion of new
hardware and software, working with vendors to maintain facilities
and order new products, and helping with technical aspects of other
projects like the SRI IMP reorganization and the new BARRNET connection.
