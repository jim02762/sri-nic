The following provides the framework for evaluating individual performance
and organizational contribution.

                            SECTION I

. Activities (Professional, Promotion, Client, Project, Institute-Related,
  etc.):  Briefly describe major efforts to which you contributed during 
  the review period;  summarize your contributions.

Completed work on NIC services via the mail system (whois, rfc's via mail).
Made postscript tree-style domain system chart.
Wrote a Tops-20 server for the SUN distributed Network File System (NFS).
Gave a talk to the SUN Systems Programming group about my Tops-20
 NFS implementation.
Received a Recognition Award from the Computer Science Laboratory for
 extra effort involved with a disk crash they had.
Attended Internet Engineering Task Force meetings regularly and was
  a member of the domain naming group.
Wrote an RFC, "Domain Server Operations Guide" to be published soon.
Attended other random meetings, including a BITNET domain naming task
  force group, and the TCP/IP interoperability conference.
Wrote a program to generate the TAC phones listing.
Wrote a program to find the closest TACs to a given location.
Got some system programs and an experimental mail system running
 using the domain system instead of the host table.
Worked with Fred on the new equipment RFP.
Setup the new SUN fileserver and workstations.


                           SECTION II

. Performance Objectives Achievement:  How well did you meet each objective 
  in your performance plan.  If there were shortfalls, how would you avoid 
  them in the future?  Include progress in meeting own professional
  development plan.

I finished learning C this year and wrote a few programs using it.
I've learned more about UNIX also.














                           SECTION III

. Professional Development:  What are your strengths and areas which can
  be improved?  Where will you concentrate your efforts?  In what areas 
  and how do you need development assistance?

Continued interest in networking protocols.
This year I will probably spend learning much more about Unix
on the SUN workstations.
