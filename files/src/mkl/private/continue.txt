Re:  Case no 510022, citation no 84-61908

Hi:

I am scheduled to appear for trial in the above matter on October 19, 1988.
I thought I had specifically mentioned in my request for the trial that
I would not be available on that date.  I will be out of town at a
meeting for my employer October 16-20, 1988.  I therefore request that
trial be continued to October 21, or as soon as possible thereafter.
Please inform me as to whether the continuance will be granted and
any new trial date and time.

Sincerely,

Mark Lottor
