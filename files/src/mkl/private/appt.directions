Tell me what time you think you'll get to my place on Sunday??

Here's some directions: 

From SFO, go SOUTH on 101.
From SJO, go NORTH on 101.

Get off 101 at Marsh Road WEST.  Go to the end of Marsh Rd (1 mile or so).

Take a LEFT onto Middlefield.  Go about a mile to the first
red/green traffic light.  Take a RIGHT onto Oak Grove.

Go down a few blocks.  Pine Street in on the left.
1055 Pine St.  Park on the street.  Building #5.
