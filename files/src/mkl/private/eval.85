Name:  LOTTOR, Mark K.             For the period: 4/29/85 to 10/25/85
Title: Jr. Systems Programmer      Organization:   677


 The following provides the framework for evaluating individual
 performance and organizational contribution.

_______________________________________________________________________________

				SECTION I

* Activities (Professional, Promotion, Client, Project, Institute-Related,
  etc.):  Briefly describe major efforts to which you contributed during
  the review period; summarize your contributions.

I'll divide this section into 3 parts.  One on my NIC activities,
one on my CSL activities (for whom I work about 12 hours a week),
and one on my own institute related activities.

For the NIC:
  - I suggested buying an accurate clock that the DEC-20 can read the
    date and time from.  The kit was built and interfaced to the system
    and is now being used.  It will soon allow any system on the internet
    to read the time.
  - I have installed many random EXEC and MONITOR hacks.  Among them
    was fixing control-L and adding a way for programs to tell the EXEC
    what to do with them once they have finished executing.
  - I wrote the user side of the remote database REGISTER program.
  - I am currently finishing a Domain Survey Program.  This has been a
    major effort.  The program will query all network domain servers
    and generate a HOSTS.TXT file from the information gathered.
  - I am also just finishing adding an alias feature to MM.

For CSL:
  - I have been helping CSL bring up TOPS-20 on their Foonly's for
    the last year or so.  This has been a long and large effort.
    I have brought up countless numbers of system and utility
    programs and made lots of additions and modifications to them.
    I was also involved in debugging TOPS-20 on the Foonly,
    the network code especially.

Institute/network related::
  - I was the first person at SRI to suggest that we start doing
    something about registering the SRI.ORG domain.  Without it we
    will no longer be up-to-date with the current internet protocols.
    I am now involved in getting this done.  It currently includes
    getting two domain servers up and running and being the maintainer
    of the SRI domain host files.
  - I have developed a network talk protocol.  It is used for real-time
    interactive communication between users on different hosts.  I have
    written a full TOPS-20 implementation and am working with someone
    who is writing one for UNIX.  I also wrote an RFC to be published soon.

				SECTION II

* Performance Objectives Achievement:  How well did you meet each
  objective in your performance plan?  If there were shortfalls,
  how would you avoid them in the future?  Include progress in meeting
  own professional development plan.

My current objective is to be promoted to Systems Programmer from
Jr Systems Programmer.  I would like for this to happen sometime 
around the middle of 1986.  I feel the current work I am doing
and my experience show that I am ready for this change.

_______________________________________________________________________________

				SECTION III

* Professional Development:  What are your strengths and areas which can be
  improved?  Where will you concentrate your efforts?  In what areas do you
  need development assistance?
  
   In the TOPS-20 area of things, I should probably learn more details
of TOPS-20 including internal MONITOR structures.  Since TOPS-20
is 'dead' and 'going out' it is not clear that I should spend any
more time learning in this area since I already know a great deal
about it.
   Instead I should probably spend more time learning the UNIX
operating system and the C language.  These will probably become
the dominant things used at the NIC in the near future as TOPS-20
fades away. (although I hope it doesn't)
   I am leaning a lot about the network domain system.  This is a
complicated area and I should be an expert in it fairly soon.  I try
to keep up with all the current protocols and this is one area
in which I like to concentrate my efforts.
